# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Key Components
1. **Header:** Displays the chat title.
2. **ChatArea:** Renders the scrollable chat history.
3. **Message:** Displays individual messages with styling and timestamps.
4. **InputField:** Handles user input and message submission.

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Roles and Attributes:** Applied to key components for screen reader compatibility.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensured for sending messages, scrolling, and retrying failed messages.

### Assumptions
- Chat history persistence is simulated using `localStorage`.
- Timestamps are displayed in a standard format for consistency.

## How It Works
- The user enters a message in the input field and presses "Enter" or clicks the send button.
- The message dynamically appears in the chat area.
- If a bot response is required, a typing indicator is shown before the bot's reply.
- Chat history is saved in `localStorage` and loaded when the session is revisited.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate with a real backend for live chat functionality.
- Add advanced bot interaction capabilities using AI.
- Include user avatars for enhanced personalization.
